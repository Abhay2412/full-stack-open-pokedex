The language I will be choosing is Python and for the CI setup linting will be done by Flake8 since it helps with both styles and logical linting. I will use Pytest to create tests since it's designed for functional and API testing. For bundling the application into an executable, I researched Pyinstaller as it works on Linux, Windows, and Mac and requires no dependencies or installation on the user end. This also guarantees a smoother experience when deploying my application. The other alternative to GitHub Actions and Jenkins is using GitLab which is similar to GitHub in the sense you can trigger builds, run tests and deploy code with each commit or push. Also, you can do all of this in a virtual machine or a Docker container. For deploying it would be best to do it in the cloud since the architecture and services I have picked will allow for an experience which involves AWS and its deploying services. This cloud-based deployment approach ensures scalability, reliability, and efficient management of my application's runtime environment. In conclusion, setting up a Python CI/CD pipeline with Flake8, Pytest, PyInstaller, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS deployment empowers you to automate your development workflow, enhance code quality, and efficiently deploy your applications to the cloud. This approach ensures a streamlined development process, ultimately leading to faster and more reliable software releases.
